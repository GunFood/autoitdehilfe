<h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td style="width:15%">Internal</td>
<td style="width:85%">Reserved for operating system use. This member, which specifies a system-dependent status, is valid when the GetOverlappedResult function returns without setting the extended error information to ERROR_IO_PENDING.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>InternalHigh</td>
<td>Reserved for operating system use. This member, which specifies the length of the data transferred, is valid when the GetOverlappedResult function returns True.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Offset</td>
<td>File position at which to start the transfer. The file position is a byte offset from the start of the file.<br />
The calling process must set this member before calling the ReadFile or WriteFile function.<br />
This member is used only when the device is a file. Otherwise, this member must be zero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OffsetHigh</td>
<td>High-order word of the file position at which to start the transfer.<br />
This member is used only when the device is a file. Otherwise, this member must be zero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hEvent</td>
<td>Handle to an event that will be set to the signaled state when the operation has completed.<br />
The calling process must set this member either to zero or a valid event handle before calling any overlapped functions.</td>
</tr>
