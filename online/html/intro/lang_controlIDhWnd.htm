    <h1>Language Reference - ControlIDs and Handles</h1>
    <p>There is a fundamental difference between creating controls using the
      native functions of AutoIt ( <b><a href="../functions/GUICtrlCreate%20Management.htm">GUICtrlCreate*()
          </a></b>) and creating similar controls using the UDFs (<b>
        _GUICtrl*_Create() </b>). The former return a ControlID - a simple
      integer value which is actually an index number to an internal AutoIt
      array which looks after all AutoIt created controls. UDFs return a handle
      - a 32 or 64 bit pointer which is a unique windows ID for all things that
      Windows creates. Of course the native-created controls have handles too
      (that is why you have the <b><a href="../functions/GUICtrlGetHandle.htm">GUICtrlGetHandle()</a></b>
      function) but AutoIt shields the user from them. </p>
    <p>AutoIt tries to make life simple for you by using ControlIDs to identify
      its native controls. You can use these ControlIDs in the native GUI
      modifying functions (e.g. <b><a href="../functions/GUICtrlUpdate Management.htm">GUICtrlSet*()</a></b>
      ) and when looking for events caused by these controls in a <b><a href="../functions/GUIGetMsg.htm">GUIGetMsg()</a></b>
      or OnEvent modes. And you can use these ControlIDs in nearly all of the
      related control UDF functions - the function will take care of the
      conversion into the corresponding handle automatically. </p>
    <p>Windows handles are unique identifiers that the OS uses to keep track of
      everything on the system, such as GUIs and controls, which continually
      send messages around the system so that everything in the system knows
      what is going on (which GUI is active, which control has just been
      triggered, which key was pressed, etc, etc). These messages contain all
      sorts of data, but essentially explain "which control has just done what".
      These handles can obviously be used in related UDF functions to identify
      the control - but you cannot use them in any of the native functions which
      require a ControlID to identify the index of the control in the internal
      array. </p>
