&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBIM_CHEVRONSTATE - The uChevronState member is valid or must be set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fStyle</td>
<td>Flags that specify the band style. This value can be a combination of the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_BREAK - The band is on a new line.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_CHILDEDGE - The band has an edge at the top and bottom of the child window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_FIXEDBMP - The background bitmap does not move when the band is resized.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_FIXEDSIZE - The band can't be sized. With this style, the sizing grip is not displayed on the band.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_GRIPPERALWAYS - Version 4.71. The band will always have a sizing grip, even if it is the only band in the rebar.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_HIDDEN - The band will not be visible.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_NOGRIPPER - Version 4.71. The band will never have a sizing grip, even if there is more than one band in the rebar.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_USECHEVRON - Version 5.80. Show a chevron button if the band is smaller than cxIdeal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT - Version 4.71. The band can be resized by the rebar control; cyIntegral and cyMaxChild affect how the rebar will resize the band.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_NOVERT - Don't show when vertical.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_USECHEVRON - Display drop-down button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_HIDETITLE - Keep band title hidden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $RBBS_TOPALIGN - Keep band in top row.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>clrFore</td>
<td>Band foreground colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>clrBack</td>
<td>Band background colors.<br />
If hbmBack specifies a background bitmap, these members are ignored.<br />
By default, the band will use the background color of the rebar control set with the $RB_SETBKCOLOR message.<br />
If a background color is specified here, then this background color will be used instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lpText</td>
<td>Pointer to a buffer that contains the display text for the band.<br />
If band information is being requested from the control and $RBBIM_TEXT is specified in fMask, this member must be initialized to the address of the buffer that will receive the text.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cch</td>
<td>Size of the buffer at lpText, in bytes. If information is not being requested from the control, this member is ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iImage</td>
<td>0-based index of any image that should be displayed in the band. The image list is set using the $RB_SETBARINFO message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hwndChild</td>
<td>Handle to the child window contained in the band, if any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cxMinChild</td>
<td>Minimum width of the child window, in pixels. The band can't be sized smaller than this value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cyMinChild</td>
<td>Minimum height of the child window, in pixels. The band can't be sized smaller than this value.</td>

<td>hbmBack</td>
<td>Handle to a bitmap that is used as the background for this band.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wID</td>
<td>UINT value that the control uses to identify this band for custom draw notification messages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cyChild</td>
<td>Version 4.71. Initial height of the band, in pixels. This member is ignored unless the $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style is specified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cyMaxChild</td>
<td>Version 4.71. Maximum height of the band, in pixels. This member is ignored unless the $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style is specified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cyIntegral</td>
<td>Version 4.71. Step value by which the band can grow or shrink, in pixels.<br />
If the band is resized, it will be resized in steps specified by this value.<br />
This member is ignored unless the $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style is specified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cxIdeal</td>
<td>Version 4.71. Ideal width of the band, in pixels.<br />
If the band is maximized to the ideal width (see $RB_MAXIMIZEBAND), the rebar control will attempt to make the band this width.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lParam</td>
<td>Version 4.71. Application-defined value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cxHeader</td>
<td>Version 4.71. Size of the band's header, in pixels.<br />
The band header is the area between the edge of the band and the edge of the child window.<br />
This is the area where band text and images are displayed, if they are specified.<br />
If this value is specified, it will override the normal header dimensions that the control calculates for the band.</td>

<td>$tagRECT</td>
<td>Version 6. Location of the chevron.</td>
